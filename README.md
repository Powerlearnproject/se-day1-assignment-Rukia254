#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, method and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. The software Engineering builds a high quality software system that meets the user needs and perform well while managing risks and costs.It helps advance the technology industry by providing structured, efficient,effective methods for software development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)The emergence Agile Methodologies- in 2001s,the event named publication of the Agile Manifesto, created by a group of software developers seeking to address the limitation of traditional methodologies like waterfall.
2)Introduction of object oriented paradigm- In 1980s, Bertrand Meyer, introduced an event called publication of object oriented software Construction and popularization of languages like C++. it allows for modelling software in terms of real world objects and their interaction leading to reusable and maintainable codes
3)Introduction of waterfall model- In 1970, Wiston W. Royce introduced an event called Publication of Managing Development of Large Software System, waterfall model, it consists of phases such as the analysis, system design, implementation,testing, deployment and maintenance for managing software projects.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1)Planning- resources needed, cost estimation and timeframe are estimated.it ensures that the project is viable and the stakeholder's need are clearly understood.
2)Requirement analysis- it involves gathering of detailed information from the stakeholders to know what the software must achieve, that is the functionality of the software.
3)Design- in this phase, the design of the system is created which include the overall system structure,models, algorithm and even the user interface.
4)Implementation- this is where the actual coding is done,code is written with the aim of producing a working system that meets the design requirements.
5)Testing- in this phase,verification of the software function is done, to see if it works as intended, if not fixing is done before deployment.
6)Deployment-the software is implemented in that it becomes available to users, making it operational for the intended purpose.
7)Maintenance- this is where the software is well monitored, by fixing and regular updated, to make it remain functional.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology involves thorough planning and execution of the predetermined stages whereby each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase ,waterfall methodology is used when requirements of the project are clearly understood and are unlikely to change, while agile methodology promotes ongoing collaboration by emphasizing contious feedback and adaption, used when project requirement are not fully  understood and are likely to change.
waterfall methodology is appropriate in senarios like developing software for finance or even healthcare ,where strict documentation are required while agile methodology is appropriate in senario like developing mobile where frequent updates are required due to demand in the market.  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes, maintains and debug codes to ensure that the software application works as it intended and meets the user requirements.a software developer ensures that the software application functions correctly and meets specific requirements. 
A quality assurance Engineer develops test plans, ensures that the software works correctly in possible situations,ensures bugs are fixed and retested before they are released and does the regression testing.
A project manager ensures projects are completed in time within the intended scope and acts as liason between the development team,stakeholders and clients.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment(IDEs) offers comprehensive enviroment for code editing and writing,debugging tools,manages codes files and also it automates the build processes.examples of Integrated Development Enviroment(IDEs) are visual studio code,intelliJ AND Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS) enables multi developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes,branching and merging without affecting the main codebase,acts as back up and recovery for the codebase and ensures that the code remains in the deployeable state at all times. example of Version Control Systems (VCS) are the Gits,Mercurial and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i)common challenges are Technical debt,such as shortcuts to meet the deadlines.technical debt can be overcomed by automated testing, code review and regular refactoring.
ii)balancing quality with speed,pressure to deliver software quickly.it can be overcomed by setting realistic expectation,contious integration and ensuring the test are written before or alongside the code.
iii)working with legacy code that is outdated,written in old programming languages can be difficult and time consuming. this can be overcomed by modernize legacy code, comprehensive testing and proper documentation of the legacy code and share knowledge to reduce the reliance on a few individuals who understand the legacy system.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i)unit testing as the name unit suggests is the testing that involves individual component or unit of software in isolation. it enables early error detection, simplifies debugging and refactor code confidently.
ii)integration testing ensures that the integrated component work together therefore it ensures interaction between different units of software.the importance of this type of testing is that it identifies interface issues,validate the design and improves the system reliability.
iii)system testing is the testing done to validate the overall system behaviour,ensures that the system meeets the specific requirememts,system testing ensures end to end validation,ensures that the system meets all the functional and non fuctional requirements and also ensure that the user experience is smooth and software behaves as user expects.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of guiding generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outputs. it ensures the AI provides accurate responses and relevant to the user needs,it breaks down complex queries into manageable tasks, helps to avoid ambiguity and leads to more effective and satisfying interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"tell me about technology"  the improved prompt of this vague prompt  is "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market in the next decade." the improved prompt os more effective because it clear, specific and concise that it it avoids the unnecessary words whlie still providing all the needed details to guide the AI's response.

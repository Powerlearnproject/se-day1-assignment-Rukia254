Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, method and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. The software Engineering builds a high quality software system that meets the user needs and perform well while managing risks and costs.It helps advance the technology industry by providing structured, efficient,effective methods for software development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1)The emergence Agile Methodologies- in 2001s,the event named publication of the Agile Manifesto, created by a group of software developers seeking to address the limitation of traditional methodologies like waterfall.
2)Introduction of object oriented paradigm- In 1980s, Bertrand Meyer, introduced an event called publication of object oriented software Construction and popularization of languages like C++. it allows for modelling software in terms of real world objects and their interaction leading to reusable and maintainable codes
3)Introduction of waterfall model- In 1970, Wiston W. Royce introduced an event called Publication of Managing Development of Large Software System, waterfall model, it consists of phases such as the analysis, system design, implementation,testing, deployment and maintenance for managing software projects.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1)Planning- resources needed, cost estimation and timeframe are estimated.it ensures that the project is viable and the stakeholder's need are clearly understood.
2)Requirement analysis- it involves gathering of detailed information from the stakeholders to know what the software must achieve, that is the functionality of the software.
3)Design- in this phase, the design of the system is created which include the overall system structure,models, algorithm and even the user interface.
4)Implementation- this is where the actual coding is done,code is written with the aim of producing a working system that meets the design requirements.
5)Testing- in this phase,verification of the software function is done, to see if it works as intended, if not fixing is done before deployment.
6)Deployment-the software is implemented in that it becomes available to users, making it operational for the intended purpose.
7)Maintenance- this is where the software is well monitored, by fixing and regular updated, to make it remain functional.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology involves thorough planning and execution of the predetermined stages whereby each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase ,waterfall methodology is used when requirements of the project are clearly understood and are unlikely to change, while agile methodology promotes ongoing collaboration by emphasizing contious feedback and adaption, used when project requirement are not fully  understood and are likely to change.
waterfall methodology is appropriate in senarios like developing software for finance or even healthcare ,where strict documentation are required while agile methodology is appropriate in senario like developing mobile where frequent updates are required due to demand in the market.  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
